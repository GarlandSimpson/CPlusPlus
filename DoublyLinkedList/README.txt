This is my implementation of a Doubly Linked List: i.e. a list with a pointer to its head and its tail. The reason I choose this was to show my implementation of the "Big 3". The copy constructor, overloaded assignment operator and the destructor for my implementation of a linked list. Also included is my implementation of the Node Class 

To run: Copy all files into desirable IDE and build or run using the "make" command via your terminal
